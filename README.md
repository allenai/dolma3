### Dolma 3
Dolma 3 consists of three datasets constructed for the OLMo 3 family of models: a pre-training dataset which we refer to as Dolma, a mid-training dataset which we refer to as Dolmino, and Longmino our context extension dataset.

This repository contains descriptions and code necessary for reconstructing Dolma 3.

For further details, please refer to the [OLMo 3 paper](https://link) and the [OLMo 3 website](https://allenai.org/olmo).
