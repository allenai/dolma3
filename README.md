### Dolma 3
Dolma 3 consists of two datasets constructed for the OLMo 3 family of models: a pre-training dataset which we refer to as Dolma and a mid-training dataset which we refer to as Dolmino.

This repository contains descriptions and code necessary for reconstructing Dolma 3.

For further details, please refer to the [OLMo 3 paper](https://link) and the [OLMo 3 website](https://allenai.org/olmo).
