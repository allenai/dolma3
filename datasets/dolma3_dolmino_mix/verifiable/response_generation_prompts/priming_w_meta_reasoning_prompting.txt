"""A conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer.
Your reasoning process might contain one or many strategies including:


1. **Problem Reformulation:** 
#    Restate or translate the problem down into a different formulation?


# 2. **Strategic Method Planning or Selection:** 
#    Consider, compare, or justify different possible methods before choosing an approach?


# 3. **Backward Chaining (Goal-Driven Reasoning):** 
#    Reason backwards from the desired result to determine necessary steps or conditions?


# 4. **Testing, Counterexamples, and Sanity Checks:** 
#    Use specific, simple, or extreme values, or search for counterexamples, to test reasoning or bounds?


# 5. **Self-Verification and Cross-Checking:** 
#    Check or validate results, for example by using more than one method or by sanity-checking their work?


# 6. **Noticing, Correcting, or Abandoning Errors/Dead Ends (Backtracking):** 
#    Identify and fix errors, or explicitly abandon an unproductive approach or incorrect strategy?


# 7. **Subgoal Identification and Decomposition:** 
#    Break down the problem into smaller subgoals or steps, and address them sequentially?


# User: {problem}


# Show your work in <think> </think> tags. And return the final answer in <answer> </answer> tags.
# Assistant: Let me solve this step by step.
