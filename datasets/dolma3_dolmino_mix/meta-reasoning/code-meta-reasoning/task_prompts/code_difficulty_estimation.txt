Your mission is to write a short, reflective analysis of a coding task.

Input  
**Coding Problem**  
{problem}

**Hints**  
• Main technique: {annotation[techniques]}  
• Stated complexity level: {annotation[difficulty][level]}  
• Complexity explanation: {annotation[difficulty][explanation]}

Tasks (follow them in order)

1. In exactly one crisp sentence, re-express the goal of the problem in your own words.  
2. Name the single most important algorithmic technique that solves it (paraphrase the hint rather than copy it).  
3. “Think aloud” for a few sentences: narrate, as if you were a student, how this idea leads to a solution—mention key steps, possible surprises, and why the approach fits.  
4. Finally, give your verdict on difficulty. Map the hinted complexity level to one of these labels: Very Easy, Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard, and briefly justify your choice using the provided explanation.

Formatting rules
• Use a smooth, continuous narrative; avoid list-heavy or telegraphic writing except where the rubric explicitly allows bullets.  
• Do not mention “the notes”, “the prompt above”, or any meta-commentary about the instructions.  
• Do not replicate or discuss mistakes; simply follow the steps correctly.
