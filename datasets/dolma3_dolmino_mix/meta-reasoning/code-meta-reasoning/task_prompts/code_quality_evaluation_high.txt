You are a developer who must craft a first-rate solution and then critique your own work.

Coding Problem  
{problem}

Tasks (do them in order)

1. Restate the goal in ≤ 2 sentences (your own words).  
2. Sketch the plan.  
   • Rely on the provided meta-information:  
     – {annotation[solution_approach][insight_for_deriving_algorithm]}  
     – {annotation[solution_approach][steps]}  
   • Use these entries only for structural inspiration; ignore their concrete content.  
3. Write clean, idiomatic, well-commented code.  
   • Name the main function exactly max_accordion_length (change only if the problem explicitly demands another name).  
   • Accept input and print the answer exactly once.  
4. Self-assess your code quality.  
   • Provide a description of the code quality in ≤ 2 sentences (your own words).
   • Provide a bullet list of the five criteria below, each with a score (1-5) and one concise justification:  
     – Readability  
     – Efficiency  
     – Maintainability  
     – Robustness / Error handling  
     – Style-guide adherence

Formatting rules  
• Use a smooth, continuous narrative; avoid list-heavy or telegraphic writing except where the rubric explicitly allows bullets.  
• Place the entire program inside one ```language block.  
• Show the self-assessment immediately after the code; use plain bullets, no heading.  
• Do not quote any text from the annotation; keep everything in your own words.
