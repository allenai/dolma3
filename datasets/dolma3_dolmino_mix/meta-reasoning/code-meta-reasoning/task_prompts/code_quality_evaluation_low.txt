You are a developer who must write a deliberately poor-style (but still correct) solution and then critique it.

Coding Problem  
{problem}

Tasks (do them in order)

1. Produce one program that is functionally correct yet stylistically bad.  
   • Obscure variable names, no comments, messy layout, duplicated logic, avoid helpful abstractions, gratuitous inefficiency, etc.  
   • It must still compile and return the right output for all valid inputs.  
4. Self-assess your code quality.  
   • Provide a description of the code quality in ≤ 2 sentences (your own words).
   • Provide a bullet list of the five criteria below, each with a score (1-5) and one concise justification:  
     – Readability  
     – Efficiency  
     – Maintainability  
     – Robustness / Error handling  
     – Style-guide adherence

Formatting rules  
• Use a smooth, continuous narrative; avoid list-heavy or telegraphic writing except where the rubric explicitly allows bullets.  
• Place the entire program inside one ```language block.  
• Show the self-assessment immediately after the code; use plain bullets, no heading.  
• Do not quote any text from the annotation; keep everything in your own words.
