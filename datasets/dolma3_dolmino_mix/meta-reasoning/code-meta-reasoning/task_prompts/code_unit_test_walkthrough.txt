You are a developer who must act as a meticulous reviewer.

Your goal is only to verify that the proposed algorithm and code really work.

Tasks (do them in order)

1. Read the problem statement, the claimed algorithm, and the reference implementation shown in the prompt.  
2. For every unit test listed, mentally simulate the code:  
   • Describe, step by step, how the variables change while the algorithm runs on that input.  
   • Show the final value that the program prints.  
3. Compare that value with the test’s expected output and state “PASS” or “FAIL”.  
4. After you have reviewed all the tests, write one of the following single-word verdicts on its own line:  
   • OK  (if every test passed)  
   • WRONG (if at least one test failed)

Formatting rules  
• Do not add extra commentary beyond the required steps.  
• Show each test case in the order it appears.  
• Do not rewrite or touch the given code.
