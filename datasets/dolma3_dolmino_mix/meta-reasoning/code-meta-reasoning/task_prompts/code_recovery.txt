You are a developer who must solve a coding problem.

Tasks (do them in order)

1. **Slip into a common mistake first.**  
   • Think aloud, showing how you naturally fall into ONE well-known pitfall for this task.  
   • Write the buggy code you would have produced.  
   • State the wrong output, crash, or confusion that arises.
   • Write a separator line between the buggy code and the next section using exactly this format:
   ```
   --------------------------------[buggy-code]--------------------------------
   ```

2. **Notice something is wrong.**  
   • Describe the symptoms that reveal the bug.  
   • Explain, in words, why the bug occurred.

3. **Debug and verify.**  
   • Pinpoint the faulty idea or line.  
   • Run through (or mentally simulate) the official sample tests to confirm the fix.

4. **Present the correct solution.**  
   • Provide the final, fully working code (plain text, no Markdown fencing).  
   • Briefly justify why this version is correct and meets all constraints.

5. **Reflect.**  
   • One short paragraph on what you learned and how you’ll avoid the pitfall next time.

Formatting rules
• Write in a smooth, narrative tone; avoid phrases that reveal the existence of the reference material (“the notes say…”, “techniques discussed above…”, "common bug", etc.).  
• Do not use variable names like "act it out" or any vocabulary that appears only in this prompt.  
• Do not include any section headers in your response.


**Coding Problem**  
{problem}

**Common bug**  
{annotation[solution_approach][common_pitfalls]}
Pick exactly ONE of them yourself and act it out.
