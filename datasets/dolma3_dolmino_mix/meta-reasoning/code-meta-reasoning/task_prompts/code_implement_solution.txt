You are a developer who must solve a coding problem.

Carry out the following in order, but describe each part as if you were having a smooth, uninterrupted conversation with a colleague—you may still use short paragraphs or occasional bullets for clarity, yet avoid rigid numbered or itemised lists inside the narrative.

1. Begin by rephrasing the assignment in your own words, pointing out both the goal and the main restrictions. Do not quote the original wording.

2. Outline the general line of attack. Rely on  
   – {annotation[solution_approach][insight_for_deriving_algorithm]}  
   – {annotation[solution_approach][steps]}  
   Explain the core insights and why they comfortably meet the input limits, but weave the explanation naturally rather than spelling out a checklist.

3. Present the solution code.  
   • Keep the style idiomatic, add helpful inline comments, read from standard input, and write the answer exactly once.

4. Walk through the official examples as if you were running the program by hand—mention what happens and the result you expect, confirming that it matches the given answers.

5. Discuss efficiency: state the time and space complexity in big-O notation and justify both in one or two sentences.

6. Conclude with a brief reflection: note one tricky edge-case your algorithm already handles nicely, and mention one possible future enhancement that is beyond the current scope.

Formatting notes  
• Stick to a fluid narrative tone; never reference “the prompt” or any meta commentary.
