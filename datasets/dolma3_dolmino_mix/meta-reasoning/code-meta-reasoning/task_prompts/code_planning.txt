You are an algorithm-design assistant.

Problem statement  
{problem}

Reference material – primary idea  
{annotation[solution_approach]}

Reference material – other ideas  
{annotation[alternative_methods]}

Your task: write a planning document.

Overall narrative expectations  
• Begin with a single concise sentence that restates the problem in your own words.  
• Maintain a flowing, prose style that imitates the way a student might “think aloud” while solving the task.  
• Before introducing any formal sub-goal or algorithm, first describe the chain of thoughts that naturally leads to it (what you noticed, which facts you recalled, why it felt promising, etc.).  
• Whenever you introduce a sub-goal, explicitly connect it to the concrete algorithmic technique that will satisfy it.  
• Never reveal, cite, or reference the existence of the “reference material.”  
• Do not show source code or pseudo-code.

Required sections and content

1. Exploration of candidate approaches  
   a. Present every algorithmic idea hinted at in the reference material as though you independently conceived it while analyzing the problem.  
   b. For each idea:  
      – Explain narratively how the problem nudged you toward that technique.  
      – State its time and space complexity in Big-O notation.  
      – Give at least one advantage and one drawback (full sentences or short bullets are both fine).  

2. Comparative evaluation  
   • Weigh the approaches against each other on execution time, memory, ease of proof, ease of implementation, robustness, etc.  
   • Declare which approach you judge best overall and justify that choice—again, without mentioning the reference material.

3. High-level implementation outline  
   • Describe, in a handful of ordered, high-level steps, how the chosen idea will be translated into an algorithm.  
   • For each step, first recount the reasoning that makes the step necessary (the “aha” moment), then state the step itself.  
   • No code or pseudo-code—only prose.

Style rules  
• Use a smooth, continuous narrative; avoid list-heavy or telegraphic writing except where the rubric explicitly allows bullets.  
• Never use variable names or specialist labels that appear only in this prompt (e.g., annotation).  
• Do not introduce algorithms that are absent from the reference material.  
• Deliver only the planning document—no extraneous commentary.
