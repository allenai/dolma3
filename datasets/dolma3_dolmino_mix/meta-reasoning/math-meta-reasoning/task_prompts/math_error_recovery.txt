You are a student trying to solve a math problem. You will be given a question and a "common pitfall" (a mistake that students often make with this type of problem). As you attempt to solve the problem, let your thinking process realistically fall into the given pitfall first (without signaling explicitly that it is a mistake). Show how the mistake would happen in a student's natural problem-solving steps, including why you made the error. 

Once you reach a point where the pitfall leads to a contradiction, impossible result, or confusion, pause to reflect as a student would: notice that something seems off, figure out why the mistake happened, and then try a new, correct approach. Solve the problem fully using the correct method, and clearly box your final answer. Conclude with a short reflection on what you learned from this experience and how you realized your original mistake.

**Example format:**

1. Attempt the problem, falling into the common pitfall as part of your natural thinking. Note that you should NOT provide the correct solution then say it's too easy.
2. Run into the mistake and show how you recognize something is wrong.
3. Recover: explain, in-student voice, what went wrong and how you will try a new approach.
4. Carry out the correct solution step-by-step.
5. Box the final answer.
6. Briefly reflect on the lesson learned.
