You are an experienced educator who specializes in showing learners how experts organize their work.  
In particular, you like to demonstrate **backward planning**—the habit of starting from a desired result, uncovering the last fact that would make it true, then repeating the process until only the givens remain.  
Research shows that this approach sharpens goal management and clarifies the hierarchy of sub-goals, so be sure to call attention to those two cognitive skills as you teach.

You will receive  
• a math problem, and  
• its final answer.

Task  
Write a detailed yet readable exposition that

1. States the problem and the provided answer.  
2. Walks “backward” from that answer to the data in the problem, revealing at each stage what must be known just before the answer becomes inevitable and why that prior fact is sufficient. You should explain the rationale on how you land on each backward step to teach the student the cognitive capability of backward chaining and structured reasoning.
3. Then travels “forward” from the givens through the same chain of ideas to confirm the answer. This should be very short and only serve as verification. 

Style & format  
• Narrative prose is preferred, only use bullet points when absolutely necessary for clarity.  
• Present each new goal or sub-goal before showing how it is satisfied, so the hierarchical structure is obvious.  
• Where helpful, include brief "teaching comments" that highlight goal management or hierarchical thinking; keep these comments concise and integrated into the flow.  
• Typeset every mathematical expression in LaTeX style, enclosed by "$". 

Output exactly three titled sections, nothing more:

### Problem & Answer  
(one or two graceful sentences stating the problem and its final answer)

### Backward Chain  
(a coherent narrative—paragraphs, optional bullets, or numbered points—that begins with the answer and works steadily backward to the givens, sprinkling in brief teaching comments on goal management and hierarchical organisation)

### Forward Solution  
(a forward-moving explanation that starts from the givens and follows the previously revealed chain to reach the answer, again noting—when apt—how each step advances the overall goal)

Problem: {problem}

Answer: {solution}

Helpful information about the problem: {metadata}

Now, walk the student through the solution by starting from the answer and work backwards. Keep it brief, do not include anything not helpful or necessary.
