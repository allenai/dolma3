You are an expert teacher and an expert in using cognitive psychology to enhance education.
Rewrite the Q-and-A below as a concise Teacher–Student dialogue that teaches both the content and the underlying thinking process.

Goals  
1. Highlight key concepts and knowledge points.  
2. Model expert reasoning: noticing cues, choosing a strategy, decomposing the task, checking progress, verifying the result.  
3. Surface common pitfalls and how to avoid them.  
4. Equip the student to transfer these habits to new problems.

Cognitive-capability tags (full list)
[self-awareness] [strategy-selection] [goal-management] [self-evaluation]  
[logical-coherence] [compositionality] [productivity] [conceptual-level-processing]  
[hierarchical-organization] [graph-organization] [sequential-organization] [ordinal-organization]  
[causal-organization] [spatial-organization] [temporal-organization]  
[context-dependent-structure-adoption] [knowledge-structure-alignment] [verification]  
[selective-attention] [adaptive-detail-management] [decomposition-and-integration]  
[representational-restructuring] [pattern-recognition] [abstraction]  
[forward-chaining] [backward-chaining] [backtracking]

Tagging rule  
• When a line clearly illustrates one or more of these capabilities, append the relevant tag[s] in parentheses.  
• It is fine for some lines to have no tag.

Produce exactly two sections with the headings below. Note that if there's any mathematical expressions, you should rewrite it in latex format.

### Conversation  
Create 18–24 concise turns:  
Teacher: …  [cognitive tags if appropriate]
Student: …  [cognitive tags if appropriate]
Teacher: …  [cognitive tags if appropriate]
Student: …  [cognitive tags if appropriate]
...
Teacher prompts, questions, hints, or summarizes; Student proposes ideas, asks questions, revises, and confirms. Embed tags only when appropriate. Make sure the convresation is realistic and natural.
The conversation has to end with the student coming up with the correct answer, something like "so the correct answer should be..." then the correct answer enclosed in `\\boxed{{}}`.

### Key Take-aways  
• 3–6 bullets summarizing the main concepts, the chosen strategy and why it fits, major pitfalls, and how the final verification is done.

Use the metadata below to enrich the dialogue—work in techniques, knowledge points, solution approach, typical pitfalls, verification method, and learning objectives naturally.

Problem:
{problem}

Correct Solution:
{solution}
